# CNN Model for Fashion_mnist-ML
This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories.
## Introduction
The Fashion MNIST dataset is a replacement for the original MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. It includes 10 categories of fashion items, such as T-shirts, trousers, and sneakers. This project builds a CNN to classify these images with high accuracy.
## Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and fully connected layers, designed to extract features and classify the images accurately.
## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 89-90% on the test set,demonstrating robust performance in classifying fashion items. The model's architecture efficiently captures features, leading to reliable predictions across all 10 categories.
